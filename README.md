## Key Simulation Features

### Control Modes
The simulation supports the following modes:
1. **Stabilization:** Maintain hover position with PD control.  
2. **Trajectory Tracking:** Follow a predefined path (e.g., circular or spiral trajectories).  
3. **Feedback Linearization:** Advanced control to directly linearize system dynamics.

### Adjustable Parameters
- **Trajectory Type:** Circular or spiral.  
- **Control Gains:** Tunable parameters for PD control (`Kp`, `Kd`) for precise performance.  
- **Simulation Time:** Configurable based on desired duration and trajectory complexity.

### Notations
- **State Variables:**
  - **Position:** \([x, y, z]\)
  - **Linear Velocities:** \([u, v, w]\) (body frame) and \([\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z}]\) (inertial frame)
  - **Angular Velocities:** \([p, q, r]\) (body frame) and \([\dot{\phi}, \dot{\theta}, \dot{\psi}]\) (inertial frame)

## Running the Simulation

1. Open the MATLAB script and configure the desired parameters:
   - **Control Mode:** Select `1` for stabilization, `3` for trajectory tracking, or `4` for feedback linearization.
   - **Trajectory Type:** Use `param.traj = 1` for circular or `param.traj = 2` for spiral.
   - Adjust PD gains or trajectory properties as required.

2. Run the script to simulate quadcopter behavior.

3. View results in the generated plots:
   - Control inputs for each rotor.
   - Position and angle evolution over time.
   - 3D trajectory visualization comparing actual and desired paths.
