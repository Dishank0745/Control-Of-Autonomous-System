# Modelling and Nonlinear Control of Quadcopter

This project involves the modeling and nonlinear control of a quadcopter, a four-rotor aerial vehicle. The report explores its dynamics, control systems, and simulation results for stabilization and trajectory tracking. The focus is on implementing a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller to achieve desired behaviors.

## Overview

A quadcopter is an underactuated nonlinear system capable of six degrees of freedom. This project covers:

- **System Modeling:**  
  - Quadcopter dynamics, including position and orientation in inertial and body frames.
  - Mathematical modeling with assumptions for control purposes.
  - Implementation of Euler angles and rotational matrices for frame transformations.  

- **Control Implementation:**  
  - Use of a PD controller to stabilize the quadcopter.  
  - Torque and thrust equations derived for roll, pitch, and yaw.  

- **Simulations:**  
  - Stabilization tests with and without PD control.  
  - Trajectory tracking for circular and spiral paths.
